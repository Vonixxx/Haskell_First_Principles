-- 1 --
-------
-- What happens if the otherwise guard lies at the top?

-- It always gets pattern matched

-------
-- 2 --
-------
-- What happens if the guards are reordered?

-- It will no longer pattern match appropriately,
-- an incorrect grade will be assigned to the input

-------
-- What is the result?
three xs
      | xs == reverse xs = True
      | otherwise = False

-- a) xs written backwards when itâ€™s True.
-- b) True when xs is a palindrome.
-- c) False when xs is a palindrome.
-- d) False when xs is reversed.
