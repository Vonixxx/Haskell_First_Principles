-- The following code samples are broken and wonâ€™t compile. The first
-- two are as you might enter them into the REPL. The third is from
-- a source file. Find the mistakes, and fix them so that the code will
-- compile:

-- 1.
-- area x = 3. 14 * (x * x)

one x = 3.14 * (x * x)

-- 2.
-- double x = b * 2

two x = x * 2

-- 3.
-- x = 7
--  y = 10
-- f = x + y

x = 7
y = 10
f = x + y
