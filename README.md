# What is This?
This is an ongoing project wherein I attempt to solve each exercise in the book "Haskell from First Principles".

## Useful Information
- Each Chapter has multiple segments with exercises. These have arbitrary names such as: "Heal the Sick" or "A Head Code".
- The files found in this repository are named after those segments. The format: Ex.(n-segment)(title).hs.
- The segments where the Book requires using the REPL are solved by using comments with the answer written out.
- The exercises are rephrased, since they are phrased in a superfluous manner within the book.
- Some exercises have been left out, since they cannot be solved (i.e. "Write out function x").
