# Information
Ongoing project wherein I attempt to solve each exercise in the book "Haskell from First Principles".
Each Chapter has various blocks of exercises spread throughout, with arbitrary names such as "Heal the Sick",
or "A Head Code". The files in each Chapter directory found in this repository are named after those exercise blocks.
So the format is like this: Ex.<n-block><title>.hs.
