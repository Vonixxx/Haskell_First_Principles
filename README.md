# Information
Ongoing project wherein I attempt to solve each exercise in the book "Haskell from First Principles".
Each Chapter has various blocks of exercises spread throughout, with arbitrary names such as "Heal the Sick",
or "A Head Code". The files in each Chapter directory found in this repository are named after those exercise blocks.
So the format is like this: Ex.(n-block)(title).hs.

I try to use source file solutions where possible, since some exercises are meant solely for the REPL.
The places where I do solve them using the REPL, though, I just place the correct solution as a comment underneath
the problem.
