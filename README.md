# Information
Ongoing project wherein I attempt to solve each exercise in the book "Haskell from First Principles".

Each Chapter has various segments with exercises, with arbitrary names such as "Heal the Sick", or "A Head Code".
The files in each directory found in this repository are named after those exercise blocks. The format:
Ex.(n-segment)(title).hs.
At the end of each chapter also lies a generic section named "Chapter Exercises", where various concepts are utilised
instead of specific ones as in the prior segments.

The segments where the Book requires using the REPL are solved by using comments with the answer within.

The problems provided are also rephrased, since the ones in the Book have some fluff to them.
Such as "Check your results in the REPL" or "Name your function x".
